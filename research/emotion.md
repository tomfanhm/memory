## Basic Emotions According to Ekman (1992)

Paul Ekman’s influential 1992 paper, _An Argument for Basic Emotions_, identified a core set of emotions that he argued are universal, biologically based, and cross-culturally recognizable. According to Ekman, the basic emotions are:

- Anger
- Disgust
- Fear
- Happiness
- Sadness
- Surprise

These six emotions are considered “basic” because they are associated with distinct, universally recognizable facial expressions and are thought to be innate across human cultures.

Ekman later suggested that the list of basic emotions could be expanded to include additional emotions such as contempt, but the original six remain the most widely cited and supported by his early research.
